# Tic-Tac-Toe
🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game is your digital take on the legendary pencil-and-paper battle. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,  it’s a minimalist, no-fuss web app where two players go head-to-head—Player X vs Player O—racing to line up three symbols in a row.

🕹️ What Happens in the Game:
- The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns tapping into a cell—Player X begins.
- The script tracks every move and checks for a winning combo: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- When someone wins, a message flashes their victory; if the grid fills with no winner, it’s a draw.
- There’s a restart button to kick off the next round instantly—no reloads needed.
  
✨ Why It Stands Out:
- Simple, elegant layout that adjusts beautifully on phones and desktops
- Snappy hover effects and smooth transitions make it feel lively
- Clear logic, crisp UI, and a restart feature that keeps the game flowing
And the best part? It’s entirely front-end—no dependencies, no installs. Just plug in the code and play.
